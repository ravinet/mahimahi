.SH NAME
delayshell - delay all network packets to and from a shell by user-specified amount
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B delayshell
\fIdelay\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
delayshell is a network emulation tool that emulates a link with a fixed
minimum round trip time (RTT). delayshell uses \fBclone\fP(2) to fork a new shell in
a distinct network namespace. Every program run inside delayshell has its IP
datagrams routed over a virtual network interface. All packets to and from an
application running inside delayshell are delayed by \fIdelay\fP, the one-way per-packet
delay specified by the user in milliseconds. delayshell can be nested within
\fBlinkshell\fP(1) to flexibly create links with a user-supplied one-way delay
and a user-supplied link rate.

To exit delayshell, simply type "exit" or CTRL-D inside delayshell. 

.SH EXAMPLE

.nf
delayshell can create a new shell such that all packets to and from a program
run within this shell are delayed by 10ms in each direction:
$ delayshell 10
