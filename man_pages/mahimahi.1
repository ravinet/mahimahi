.SH NAME
Mahimahi - tools to produce a usable benchmark for Web transport protocols and browser modifications
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mahimahi is a set of lightweight tools that can be used to completely record actual Web pages 
and replay them locally over different emulated links. Mahimahi comprises of four tools:
\fBdelayshell\fP(1), \fBlinkshell\fP(1), \fBrecordshell\fP(1), and \fBreplayshell\fP(1). 

\fBdelayshell\fP(1) emulates a link with a fixed minimum round trip time by delaying all network packets to and from a shell by a user-specified amount of time.  

\fBlinkshell\fP(1) emulates both time-varying links and fixed-speed links by delivering all network packets to and from a shell according to packet-delivery trace files.

\fBrecordshell\fP(1) records complete Web pages by recording all HTTP content sent to and from a shell running a Web browser.

\fBreplayshell\fP(1) replays previously recorded Web pages while accurately mirroring each page's sharding structure. \fBreplayshell\fP(1) creates a shell where browsers can load recorded Web pages locally.
